# Device-Manager-App



My project boilerplate using ASP.Net core for API and Angular for UI.
In this solution I exercise various best practices, design patterns and arhitecutral styles

So far I've implemented :

* 3 Layer Arhitecutre.
* Meditar + CQRS.
* Abstracting AutoMapper through services for additional logic.
* EF Core.
* JWT Authentication and Authorization .
* UnitOfWork + Repository pattern.
* Implementing open-closed principle using table filters generated by an abstract factory.
* Exception handling pattern.
* TDD ,unit tests
* Angular
